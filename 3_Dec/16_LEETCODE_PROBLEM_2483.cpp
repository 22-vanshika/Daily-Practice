// 2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop

// You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed
// string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':

// if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour
// whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.
// If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated
// as follows:

// For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty
// increases by 1. For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come,
// the penalty increases by 1. Return the earliest hour at which the shop must
// be closed to incur a minimum penalty.

// Note that if a shop closes at the jth hour, it means the shop is closed at
// the hour j.

// Example 1:

// Input: customers = "YYNY"
// Output: 2
// Explanation:
// - Closing the shop at the 0th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
// - Closing the shop at the 1st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
// - Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.
// - Closing the shop at the 3rd hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.
// - Closing the shop at the 4th hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.
// Closing the shop at 2nd or 4th hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is
// earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.
